# RNA2Drawer

Quickly edit nucleic acid secondary structures and export the drawings as PowerPoint or SVG files. All elements of the drawings (e.g. bases, bonds) are exported as individual PowerPoint or SVG objects, allowing for further manipulation in PowerPoint or Adobe Illustrator. Fonts, colors, and base layout are all customizable in RNA2Drawer, and bases can be colored according to structure probing data (e.g. SHAPE).

## Installation (Windows)

Download the ZIP file<b>*</b> of the Windows executable for RNA2Drawer [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rna2drawer/). Inside the ZIP file will just be a folder named `RNA2Drawer`. You can extract this folder to anywhere on your computer. (A convenient place might be your Desktop.) After you've extracted the folder, enter it. Inside you'll find an Application file named `RNA2Drawer`. Right-click it, highlight `Send to`, and click `Desktop (create shortcut)`. Now you can open RNA2Drawer by just clicking the shortcut on your Desktop.

There might be a delay the first time you open RNA2Drawer as Windows performs a security scan. Windows might also ask you to give permission for the application to run.

<b>*A ZIP file is a compressed file format. Its contents must be extracted (decompressed) for them to be used.</b>

## Creating a New Structure

`File` -> `New` allows you to enter a new sequence that will be drawn entirely single-stranded, or enter a sequence and structure in dot-bracket notation.

From the `File` menu or corresponding buttons on the toolbar, you can enter in a plain sequence or structure in dot-bracket notation, or open from a file that is.
