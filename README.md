## Installation

### Windows 10

Download the ZIP file<b>*</b> of the Windows executable for RNA2Drawer [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rna2drawer/). Inside the ZIP file will be just a folder named `RNA2Drawer`. You can extract this folder to anywhere on your computer. (A convenient place might be your Desktop.) After you've extracted the folder, enter it. Inside you'll find an Application file named `RNA2Drawer`. Right-click it, highlight `Send to`, and click `Desktop (create shortcut)`. Now you can open RNA2Drawer by double-clicking the shortcut on your Desktop.

There might be a delay the first time you open RNA2Drawer as Windows performs a security scan. Windows might also ask you to give permission for the application to run.

<b>*A ZIP file is a compressed file format. Its contents must be extracted (decompressed) before they can be used.</b>

### Mac and Linux

## Creating a New Structure

In `File` -> `New`, you can enter a plain sequence that will be drawn single-stranded, or enter the dot-bracket notation of a structure.

In `File` -> `Open`, you can open: <em>i</em>) a plain sequence, <em>ii</em>) a FASTA file, <em>iii</em>) the dot-bracket notation of a structure, <em>iv</em>) a CT file generated by Mfold, or <em>v</em>) the RNA2Drawer file of a saved tab.

Make sure that whatever you input complies with the parsing steps detailed in the popup windows.

## The Structure Editing Canvas

Each structure is drawn in a separate tab of the structure editing canvas. The structure editing canvas has two editing modes: folding and pivoting. Switch between them using the `Mode` buttons on the toolbar.

### Folding Mode

This editing mode allows you to pair and unpair bases.

Clicking a base selects it, and pressing the left and right arrow keys adds/removes neighboring bases from the selection. (Holding `Shift` while pressing the left and right arrow keys adds/removes neighboring bases from the other side of the selection.)

The structure editing canvas automatically highlights all subsequences complementary to the currently selected subsequence. Complementary subsequences whose pairing would not invalidate the secondary structure are highlighted in pink, and clicking on them will form the pairing in the secondary structure. All other complementary subsequences are highlighted in blue, and clicking on them will open a popup to form a tertiary interaction with them (see [Tertiary Interactions](#tertiary-interactions)).

Alternatively, selecting and clicking a set of bases that are already paired will break all base pairs involving those bases. The currently selected subsequence will be highlighted in red when clicking on it would break base pairs and it is hovered.

The bottom bar of the structure editing canvas contains some helpful information: (from left to right) what clicking the mouse will do, the currently selected subsequence, the number of pairable subsequences, and the sequence range.

</p>

### Pivoting Mode

In this editing mode you can pivot stems around their loops, allowing you to control the layout of your drawing and resolve base overlaps.

Every stem will have a pivoter (a blue line) running down its center. Left-clicking a pivoter and moving the mouse will pivot the stem in the direction of the mouse, first compressing the single strand that the stem pivots towards and then expanding the single strand on the other side of the stem. Right-clicking a pivoter will only expand the single strand away from the mouse movement.

## Drawing Styles

RNA2Drawer has three drawing styles: radial, flat base, and rigid. Structures are drawn in the radial style by default. Switch between them using the `Draw` buttons on the toolbar.

### The Radial Drawing Style

<p align="center">
  <img src="radial1-crop.png" width="450" />
</p>

You can edit the following parameters in `Drawing` -> `Radial Styles`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Rotation`: The rotation of the drawing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Base Pair Bond Length`: How long base pair bonds are.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Termini Gap Size`: The distance between the 5' and 3' ends of the sequence.<br />

### The Flat Base Drawing Style

<p align="center">
  <img src="flat-base0-crop.png" width="850" />
</p>

You can edit the following parameters in `Drawing` -> `Flat Base Styles`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Rotation`: The rotation of the drawing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Base Pair Bond Length`: How long base pair bonds are.<br/>

### The Rigid Drawing Style

<p align="center">
  <img src="rigid2-crop.png" width="850" />
</p>

You can edit the following parameters in `Drawing` -> `Rigid Styles`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Rotation`: The rotation of the drawing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Include Base Pair Bonds`: Toggle to draw base pair bonds.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Base Pair Bond Length`: The length of base pair bonds.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Minimum Branch Angle`: How squat multibranch loops can be.

You cannot pivot stems with the rigid drawing style.

### General Styles

The following parameters are common to all drawing styles. You can edit them in `Drawing` -> `General Styles`.

Colors used are the CSS web standards.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Base` -><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Base Font`: The font of bases (e.g. Arial Narrow, Times New Roman).<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Background` -><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Background Color`: The color of the background.<br />

## Other Customizations

In the `Edit` dropdown menu, you can change:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Name`: The name of the current tab.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sequence Numbering Offset`: The shift in numbering. (Same as in Mfold.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Numbering Start`: Determines what position numberings start at.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Numbering Interval`: The spacing between numberings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Convert to DNA (Us to Ts)`: Converts all Us to Ts while maintaining all base pairs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Convert to RNA (Ts to Us)`: Converts all Ts to Us while maintaining all base pairs.

## Rotation

You can rotate your drawing using the options in the `Transform` dropdown menu.

## Base Colors and Outlines/Fills

The color of a base refers to the color of its letter. Additionally, a circle can be drawn behind a base, whose outline and fill can be adjusted. Base colors and outlines/fills can be set in the `Annotate` dropdown menu.

The following parameters can be set for base outlines/fills.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Outline Color`: The color of the outline of the circle.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Outline Thickness`: The thickness of the outline of the circle.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Fill Color`: The color of the inside of the circle.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Radius`: The size of the circle.

Colors used are the CSS web standards.

Base colors and outlines/fills can be set by the following schemes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`By Position`: A set of positions.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`By Subsequence`: e.g. all Us in a structure, all instances of AUGC.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`By Structure`: Whether a base is paired or unpaired.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`By Structure Probing Data (e.g. SHAPE)`: A set of reactivity values (or any set of values) read from a file.

The popups for setting base colors and outlines/fills contain more detailed instructions on setting base colors and outlines/fills by these schemes.

</p>

## Noncanonical Base Pairs

In `Annotate` -> `Add a Noncanonical Base Pair`, you can specify two positions to pair, regardless of canonical base pairing rules. This will form the base pair so long as it does not invalidate the secondary structure. The noncanonical base pair is treated like any other base pair in the secondary structure. The color of noncanonical base pair bonds is determined by the `Noncanonical Bond Color` drawing parameter in [General Styles](#general-styles).

RNA2Drawer does not decorate noncanonical base pair bonds (e.g. with squares, triangles) to indicate specific types of noncanonical base pairs. Users are left to decorate noncanonical base pair bonds in exported PowerPoint and SVG files.

If you do not want a noncanonical base pair to be incorporated in the secondary structure, it can be represented as a tertiary interaction (see [Tertiary Interactions](#tertiary-interactions)).

## Tertiary Interactions

Tertiary interactions (e.g. pseudoknots, kissing loop interactions) are represented by a curved line connecting two subsequences, with a line drawn over each of the two subsequences capping them. Tertiary interactions can be added in `Annotate` -> `Add a Tertiary Interaction`.

The curve of a tertiary interaction can be adjusted by left-clicking it and moving the mouse. Right-clicking the curve of a tertiary interaction opens a popup that allows you to edit its parameters. You can set the following parameters for a tertiary interaction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Line Color`: The color of the lines of a tertiary interaction.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Line Thickness`: The thickness of the lines of a tertiary interaction.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Top Padding`: The distance between bases and the tops of the caps.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Side Padding`: The distance between bases and the sides of the caps.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Side Length`: The length of the sides of the caps.

Colors used are the CSS web standards.

Setting `Top Padding` and `Side Length` to negative values will draw the caps over the inner sides of the two subsequences of a tertiary interaction.

To represent a noncanonical base pair as a tertiary interaction, set the two subsequences of the tertiary interaction to the two positions that you want to pair. You may also uncheck the options to draw caps over the two positions.

## Saving Your Work

You can save a tab and all of its contents in an RNA2Drawer file (with the extension `.rna2drawer`). This is a text file containing all the details of a tab's structure drawing (e.g. fonts, colors, base pairs). Opening an RNA2Drawer file in RNA2Drawer will open the tab exactly as it was when it was saved.

## Exporting Your Drawing

In the `Export` dropdown menu, you can export your drawing as a PowerPoint or SVG file. All aspects of the drawing (e.g. bases, bonds) will be drawn as PowerPoint or SVG objects, allowing for further manipulation in PowerPoint or a vector graphics editor such as Adobe Illustrator. Scale your exported drawing by specifying the font size of bases in the popup window. All other aspects of the drawing (e.g. line thicknesses) will be scaled along with the font size of bases.

The `Export` dropdown menu also allows you to export the dot-bracket notation and Mfold forcings of the secondary structure of your drawing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<em>How do I zoom in and out?</em> Changing the font size of bases using the `Font Size` scale on the toolbar mimics zooming in and out, though this does not change the sizes of the other elements of the drawing.

<em>Can I draw DNA instead of RNA?</em> Yes, when entering a new structure or opening one from a file, you can parse the sequence as DNA. You can also convert an existing RNA structure to DNA (see [Other Customizations](#other-customizations)).

<em>I cannot pivot the stem closest to the 5' terminus.</em> The stem closest to the 5' terminus serves as an anchor for the entire drawing. The angle of the stem closest to the 5' terminus can only be changed by rotating the entire drawing (see [Rotation](#rotation)).
