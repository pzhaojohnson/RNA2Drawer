# RNA2Drawer

Quickly edit nucleic acid secondary structures and export the drawings as PowerPoint or SVG files. All elements of the drawings (e.g. bases, bonds) are exported as individual PowerPoint or SVG objects, allowing for further manipulation in PowerPoint or Adobe Illustrator. The fonts, colors, and layout of bases and bonds can all be customized in RNA2Drawer, by manual specification or chemical structure probing data (e.g. SHAPE).
