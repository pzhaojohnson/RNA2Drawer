# RNA 2D Drawer

Quickly edit nucleic acid secondary structures and export the drawings as PowerPoint or SVG files. All elements of the drawings (e.g. bases, bonds) are exported as individual PowerPoint or SVG objects, allowing for further manipulation in PowerPoint or Adobe Illustrator. Fonts, colors, and layout are all customizable in RNA2Drawer. The colors of bases can also be annotated by chemical structure probing data (e.g. SHAPE).
